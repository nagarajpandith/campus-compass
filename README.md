An Android App for Indoor Navigation in College Blocks using 360-Degree Images

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**:
- Navigating through college blocks can be difficult and time-consuming, especially for newcomers.
- The lack of indoor physical maps adds to the problem, leading to confusion and wasted time.
- Our Android app aims to simplify the navigation process by providing users with a 360-degree image-based path that leads from their source to the destination room within a college block.

**ABSTRACT**:
- This project aims to develop an Android app that provides indoor navigation in one of our college's blocks using 360-degree images.
- The app will allow users to select their source and destination rooms on a map of the block, and it will generate a 360-degree image-based path that leads from the source to the destination.
- The app will be developed for Android smartphones and will use Java programming language.
- The app will be user-friendly and will provide accurate directions and location tracking, reducing the time and effort required to find one's way between different rooms and buildings.

**TECH STACK**:
- Java programming language for Android app development
- Android Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- Git for version control and collaboration
